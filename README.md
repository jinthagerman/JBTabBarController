# JBTabBarController

**JBTabBarController** aims to be a drop-in replacement of `UITabBarController`, but with the intention of letting developers easily customise its appearance. **JBTabBar** uses images for all UI elements except for the labels on TabBar items. This gives the Developer/Designer the freedom to customise all aspects of the TabBar. 

In particular, the images for selected and unselected states can be specified and are colour images not clipping masks. `UITabBarItem+JBAdditions.h` adds an additional property (`selectedImage`) to `UITabBarItem` which specifies the image to show in the selected state. 30 pixel squared images (60 pixels for Retina displays) are recommended for this purpose.

## Installation Notes
To use, import all the files in the **JBTabBarController** folder into your project and include "`JBTabBarController.h`" where ever it is needed or in your precompiled header. 

Also, include "`JBTabBarController+ConvenienceMethods.h`" if you want to use the convenience property added to `UIViewController`. This property works the same as the `tabBarController` property on `UIViewController` and gives you access to the relevant **JBTabBarController** from any of the `UIViewController`s contained in it. Using this property currently requires **JRSwizzle**.

The project uses ARC and targets iOS 4.0+ devices.

## Todo
* Convert **JBTabBar** to `UIControl`
* Make **JBTabBar** titles more configurable (font, colour, shadow)
* Make **JBTabBar** more dynamic (swizzle `UIViewController` title property)
* More example TabBars (i.e replicate Apple Trailers and Twitter app tabbars)
* Adopt more `UITabBarController` conventions and behaviours
* Make the example compile without **JRSwizzle**

## Example Resources

The included example attempts to emulate the standard `UITabBar` design provided by Apple. The layer styles used to create the TabBar images in Photoshop are in the Extras folder.

The example **JBTabBar** uses the following icons from the following authors (all from The Noun Project)
